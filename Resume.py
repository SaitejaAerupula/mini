Mini Project Base Paper: Resume Screening and Shortlisting using Machine Learning

Title: Machine Learning-Based Resume Screening and Shortlisting System

Objective:
To design and develop a system that automates the resume shortlisting process using machine learning algorithms to improve recruitment efficiency.

Step-by-Step Explanation with Solution:

Step 1: Problem Statement
Traditional resume screening is manual, time-consuming, and biased. The objective is to automate the screening and classification of resumes using machine learning.

Step 2: Data Collection
Dataset: Use publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle IT Resume Dataset with 963 resumes and 25 job categories).

Step 3: Preprocessing
- Drop unwanted features (e.g., phone numbers, emails)
- Handle null values
- Lemmatize words using NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
- Vectorize text using TF-IDF or Bag of Words

Step 4: Resume Shortlisting
- Convert job description and resume text to vectors
- Compute similarity scores using cosine similarity
- Rank resumes based on similarity scores (descending order)

Step 5: Resume Classification
- Apply ML models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest
- Train and test models using labeled resume categories
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)

Step 6: Model Selection
- Based on the IRJET paper, SVM provided the highest accuracy for classification
- Cosine similarity efficiently ranked resumes for shortlisting

Step 7: Result and Deployment
- Output: Ranked and classified resumes
- Frontend: Simple interface to upload resumes and JD
- Backend: Python with Flask/Django
- ML Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, spacy

Conclusion:
The system automates resume screening, reducing bias and improving recruiter efficiency. Future enhancements can use deep learning and semantic similarity models like BERT for improved accuracy.
